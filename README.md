<h2> Prologue</h2>
<p> There was Moto and there was Hito, two best friends who go on lots of adventures. They live in a quiet network called Main. But every day something werid happens, but they will try to fix it. Each story shows that they'll be there for each other no matter what! Enjoy!</p>

<h2> Chapter One</h2>
<p> Once upon a time there was a programmer, but the programmer wasn't human. He was a hihgly intelligent robot, Moto. He had artificial intelligence what made him so smart. But one day he got lost in his own network. He was walking through his gallery and suddenly a cool chill vibe floated around Moto. Moto ran away, but he didn't look and got stuck in a huge spidernetwork, a<strong> VIRUS</strong>. Most of the time he recognized the viruses and deleteted them but this time he didn't see it coming.</p>

<h2> Chapter Two</h2>
<p>Moto got stuck in a huge spidernetwork. Meanwhile Hito, another programming robot, was at home and thougt 'let's go for a walk'. But when Hito was walking next to the crossy road, he also felt a vibe, but not a cold vibe, it was one that was very hot. So hot that he could feel his hardware melt. He looked around if anything was near the crossy road, but there was no one. Hito ran to his house and checked immidiately for viruses. And there it was, a huge spidernetwork, in the middle of town. Hito packed his Malware Bytes and his Anti Virus gear and was running towards the center. But when he saw the spidernetwork, his face wanted to look away form the horror. His best friend Moto was stuck and nearly dead. Just hanging there as a useless doll. </p>

<h2> Chapter Three</h2>
<p> Moto felt a strange movement on his right, he looked up ad saw his best friend Hito. He tried to say something, but he was so powerless that he couldn't move nor speak. Hito looked and him and said: 'I will get you out, and if you are better we are going to defeat this monsterous network togheter!' No more talking, no more thinking, Moto was freed from the virus and Hito brought him home. Hito decided to put Moto on a fast charge cable to feed him enough so Moto could get his strenght back.</p>

<h2>Last Codeline </h2>
<p> It was a normal day but everything was dark. The monsterous spidernetwork had increased his size and damage. But there were only two little lights in that darkness. One big <strong>M</strong> and one big <strong>H</strong>. Those lights were Moto and Hito, two fighting programmers in order to save the network and clease it from viruses. 115 MegaBytes later it was done. The only thing that was left of the virus was a little spider, black with deepblue eyes.</p>

<h2>After</h2>
<p>The spider looked up and tried to get away. Moto and Hito kinda felt sorry fot hin and deicided not to kill it.It got locked away in a huge safe. But the safe was decorated so it would feel like home for the spider. Although there were virussuppressors in every corner, the spider was gratefull and thanked Moto and Hito for leading him down the right way. Moto and Hito made 4 more spiders for the little spider, so he wouldn't be alone.</p>
